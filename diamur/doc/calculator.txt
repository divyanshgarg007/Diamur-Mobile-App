tile joint calculator:

1.We select a product. A consumption is linked to that product.
  So in the backend we need to be able to add a product name, along with a value for consumption.
2.Enter a length of the tile: set default 600 mm
3.Enter a width of the tile: set default 600 mm
4.Enter a width of the joint: set default 5 mm
5.Enter a depth of the joint: set default 10 mm
6.Enter a total area: default at 1m2
7.Result is weight of the joint
  Calculation:
  (width of the joint x thickness of the joint x width of the tile + width of the joint x length of the joint x length of tile) / (width of the tile + width of the joint) * 1000 * 1000 * consumption of the product / 1000000000 * the total area

The products we have here for now
- J200: 2.000
- P500 liquid processed: 1.923077
- P500 Earth Moist Processed: 2.083333

mortar calculator:

1.We select a stone choice. A length and a height of the stone are linked to this stone.
  So in the backend we should be able to add a brick name, along with a value for length and height in mproductm.
2.Enter the depth of the joint: default 20 mm
3.Enter the height of the joint: default 12 mm
4.We select a mortar type. A kg mortar/l is linked to this type of mortar. In the backend we must therefore be able to add mortar types with title and a value for the kg mortar/l
5.Enter a total area: default at 1m2 ==added input text in design(Bidya)
6.Result is calculated like this:
  (Height joint x (length stone + height stone + 2 x height joint) x depth stone / (length stone + height joint) / (height stone + height joint)) x mortar type x number of square meters.

Stone Choice:
Name	Lenght	Heighth	Depth	product_url
M50	  188 mm	88 mm	  48 mm	
M65	  188 mm 	88 mm	  63 mm	
WF	  210 mm	105 mm	48 mm	
WV65	210 mm	105 mm	65 mm	
DL	  288 mm	88 mm	  48 mm	
RV	  180 mm	80 mm	  40 mm	



Joint mortar calculator:

1.We select a stone choice. A length, a height and a depth of the stone are linked to this stone.
  So in the backend we should be able to add a brick name, along with a value for length and height in mm. : 
  where to add brick name? Along with length and height..??

2.Enter the height of the joint: default 12 mm
3.We select a group type. A density is linked to this type of mortar. So in the backend we should be able to add mortar types with title and a value for the density (for now only 1: VMK200): where to save and where to display..??

4.Enter a total area: default at 1m2
5.Result is calculated like this:
  (Height joint x depth joint x (length brick + height brick + height joint)/(length brick+height joint)/(height brick+height joint)) x the density x surface area (number of m2)

Stone Choice:
Name	Length	Heighth	Depth
M50	  188 mm	88 mm	  48 mm
M65	  188 mm 	88 mm	  63 mm
WF	  210 mm	105 mm	48 mm
WV65	210 mm	105 mm	65 mm
DL	  288 mm	88 mm	  48 mm
RV	  180 mm	80 mm	  40 mm


Tile adhesive calculator:
1.Enter the width of the notched trowel: default at 10 mm
2.Enter the height of the notched trowel: default at 10 mm
3.A height of the adhesive is calculated as volts:
 (Sinus(45x (PI/180)) x height of the notched trowel
4.A volume of glue per square meter is also calculated
  Width of notched trowel x height of adhesive / (width notched trowel + notched trowel) x 1000 / 1000000 x 1000
5.We select a kind of glue. One kg of glue per l is determined by the choice of glue. In the backend we have to provide that we can set a glue choice with title and a value for the kg glue per l.
6.Enter the number of square meters: default on 1 m2
7.Suits:
  Volume of glue per square meter x the choice of glue x the square meter
